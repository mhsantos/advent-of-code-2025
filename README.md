# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

This year I'm using Go as the programming language.

First, download the input and save it in the input folder, with the name `day<a|b|example>.txt`. `a|b|example` correspond to the Part 1, Part2 and example inputs respectively.

To run the command for a given day, run `go run ./day# <part1|part2|example>`

[Day 1: Secret Entrance](./day1/)

[Day 2: Gift Shop]()

[Day 3: Lobby]()
